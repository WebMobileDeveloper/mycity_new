<p>Hi {receipent},</p> 
<p>You may or may not know that I am a member of a terrific referral organization called mycity.com. 
The purpose of mycity.com is to make the best referral introductions possible. 
We do this by maintaining a rating system.</p>
<br/>
<p>One of my networking partners, {rated_by}, recently rated a {introducee_profession} as a professional who is interested in growing their business through networking. 
I thought you would appreciate an introduction and could potentially find a way to do business together. 
</p>
<p>Please reach out to:<br/>
<strong>{introducee}</strong>,<br/>
{introducee_profession}<br/>
{introducee_phone} Mobile<br/>
{introducee_email} Email<br/>
</p>

<p>When you connect with {introducee}, please remember to tell him that Kirk and I sent you and we look forward to speaking with him again soon.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about this referral or My City, call me at {sender_phone}.</p>
<p>
Sincerely, <br />
