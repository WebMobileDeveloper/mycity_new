			 <h2 >Suggestion Referral Tool</h2>   
			  <p>
			 The purpose of networking groups is to give and receive referrals. Mycity has developed software for creating introductions/referrals between networking partners. Here is an example: Partner A knows a financial planner with a high rating. The financial planner would like to meet a CPA. Partner B knows a CPA with a high rating. The system makes a suggested introduction/referral. Both partners are informed and if they feel the introduction is worthwhile they will follow through with the introduction. The partners will be acknowledged for having given introductions/referrals. This helps their brand and their popularity.
