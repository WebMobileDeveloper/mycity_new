			  Since 70-90% of your new business comes from people you know, this section is important. 10 years ago the average person knew 150-180 people. Today people know 500-1000 people due to social media and mobile communication devlces. By giving introductions/referrals to the people you know is a great way to strengthening your relationships. Add people you know. Rate them and ask who they wish to meet. Work with your referral partners to give and in doing so receive referrals.
